Most of the widely used models for determining static equilibrium have been developed empirically. As such, they have no theoretical basis in itself and are only valid in certain simple cases. To overcome these problems, Gainza et al., (2018) proposed a free-shape model which is a process based on the longshore current velocity formula. This model hypothesizes that static states of beach planform are reached when the mean surf-zone longshore velocity averaged over a time period is null from each profile.
